1.	How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software involves extensively reviewing the requirements of the final product. If it is a school project a parse through the provided rubric and if it is a professional project, I meet with the client to discuss. Once I’ve reviewed any provided information, I ask any questions that remain unclear to have a solid plan from which to building my software. A major difference between this project and previous projects was that the idea of creating and rendering primitive shapes was completely new, and I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect as I would’ve with more traditional programs.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?
Since I was learning something entirely new to me, I managed to paint myself into a corner in the first few milestones. I learned how to draw one 3D object but didn’t fully understand that a lot more work would be involved to draw two or more objects. After the first few milestones I needed to rewrite a lot of my code to allow for this. Typically, I can learn new coding applications on the fly while executing my software design plan but in this case I really should have done more research before breaking ground. Iterations were huge during this project in order to get each aspect of my 3D scene fine-tuned.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I can use computational graphics and visualizations in many applications in my work as a GIS analyst. I am often tasked with displaying spatial information in a visual manner and it would be immensely useful to display that data in a 3D scene. The primary GIS software (ArcGIS) actually has a subprogram that allows a user to create a 3D scene.
